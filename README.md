## 🔧 Configuration

### Configuration File

The configuration file is automatically created at `~/.swift-mcp/config.json`:

```json
{
  "sources": {
    "sundell": { 
      "enabled": true,
      "quality": 60
    },
    "vanderlee": { 
      "enabled": true,
      "quality": 60
    },
    "pointfree": { 
      "enabled": false,
      "quality": 60
    },
    "patreon": { 
      "enabled": false
    }
  },
  "cache": {
    "ttl": 86400
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable/disable a source |
| `quality` | number | `60` | Minimum quality score (0-100) |
| `cache.ttl` | number | `86400` | Cache time-to-live in seconds |

## 🔑 Environment Variables

swift-mcp uses environment variables for optional premium features. Free sources work without any configuration.

### Available Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PATREON_CLIENT_ID` | For Patreon | OAuth client ID from Patreon Developer Portal |
| `PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET` | For Patreon | OAuth client secret from Patreon Developer Portal |
| `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` | For YouTube | Google API key for YouTube content |

### Setting Variables in MCP Client Config (Recommended)

The recommended way to configure environment variables is through your MCP client's configuration file. This passes variables directly to the swift-mcp server.

#### Cursor

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swift": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@efremidze/swift-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PATREON_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swift": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@efremidze/swift-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PATREON_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windsurf

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swift": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@efremidze/swift-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PATREON_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "swift": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@efremidze/swift-mcp@latest"],
        "env": {
          "PATREON_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
          "PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Local Development

For local development and testing, you can use a `.env` file in the project root:

1. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your credentials:
   ```bash
   # .env
   PATREON_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

3. The `.env` file is automatically loaded when running the server locally.

> **Note:** Never commit `.env` files to version control. The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`.

## 💡 Usage Examples

Once installed, ask your AI assistant natural questions:

### Basic Queries

```
"Show me best practices for SwiftUI animations"
→ Returns curated animation best practices from all free sources

"What does Sundell say about testing?"
→ Returns testing-related content specifically from Swift by Sundell

"Explain navigation patterns in SwiftUI"
→ Returns navigation architecture guidance and patterns
```

### Advanced Queries

```
"Show me performance tips from van der Lee"
→ Filters to Antoine van der Lee's performance-related content

Patreon requires OAuth apps to be registered by creators. You don't need to launch a creator page or become an active creator - just register as one to create an OAuth app for personal use.

#### Setup Steps

1. **Start the setup wizard:**
   ```bash
   swift-mcp setup --patreon
   ```

2. **Follow the interactive prompts** to:
   - Create a Patreon OAuth application
   - Set up redirect URIs
   - Configure credentials

3. **Complete OAuth authentication** in your browser

4. **Start using premium content** immediately!

#### What You Get

- ✅ Access to premium tutorials and patterns from creators you support
- ✅ Automatic extraction of code from downloadable content
- ✅ Quality filtering and advanced search
- ✅ Multi-creator support
- ✅ Private, secure authentication

2. **swift-mcp Processing**: The server searches enabled sources based on your query
3. **Content Retrieval**: Fetches and parses content from RSS feeds, APIs, and cached data
4. **Quality Filtering**: Applies configurable quality thresholds
5. **Response**: Returns formatted, relevant patterns and examples to your AI assistant

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Installation Problems

**Error: Node version incompatible**
```bash
# Check your Node version
node --version

# Should be >= 18.0.0
# Update Node if needed: https://nodejs.org
```

**Error: Permission denied during global install**
```bash
# Use npx without global install
npx @efremidze/swift-mcp@latest

# Or fix npm permissions:
# https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors
```

#### Configuration Issues

**Sources not returning results**
```bash
# Verify sources are enabled
swift-mcp source list

# Check configuration file exists
ls ~/.swift-mcp/config.json

# Re-run setup if needed
swift-mcp setup
```

#### Patreon Integration Issues

**OAuth redirect not working**
- Ensure redirect URI is exactly: `http://localhost:3000/patreon/callback`
- Check no other process is using port 3000
- Verify OAuth credentials are correctly set

**No premium content showing**
- Confirm you have active Patreon subscriptions to iOS creators
- Re-authenticate: `swift-mcp auth patreon`
- Check Patreon source is enabled: `swift-mcp source list`
