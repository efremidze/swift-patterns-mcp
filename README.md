## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @efremidze/swift-mcp
```

### Configure Your AI Assistant

#### Cursor

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en-US/install-mcp?name=swift&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEBlZnJlbWlkemUvc3dpZnQtbWNwQGxhdGVzdCJ9)

Or manually add to **Cursor Settings** → **Tools** → **MCP Servers**:

`.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swift": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@efremidze/swift-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, add the following to your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file. To learn more, see the Cursor documentation.

#### Claude Code

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add swift -- npx -y @efremidze/swift-mcp@latest
```

Or manually add to your project's `.mcp.json` file:

`.mcp.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swift": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@efremidze/swift-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the configuration, restart Claude Code and run /mcp to see the HeroUI MCP server in the list. If you see Connected, you're ready to use it.

See the Claude Code MCP documentation for more details.

#### Windsurf

Add the HeroUI server to your project's `.windsurf/mcp.json` configuration file:

`.windsurf/mcp.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swift": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@efremidze/swift-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the configuration, restart Windsurf to activate the MCP server.

See the Windsurf MCP documentation for more details.

#### VS Code

To configure MCP in VS Code with GitHub Copilot, add the swift-mcp server to your project's `.vscode/mcp.json` configuration file:

`.vscode/mcp.json`
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "swift": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@efremidze/swift-mcp@latest"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the configuration, open `.vscode/mcp.json` and click Start next to the heroui-react server.

See the VS Code MCP documentation for more details.

### Test It Out

In your AI assistant, try:

```
"Show me SwiftUI animation patterns"
"What does Sundell say about testing?"
"Explain navigation patterns in SwiftUI"
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The configuration file is automatically created at `~/.swift-mcp/config.json`:

```json
{
  "sources": {
    "sundell": { "enabled": true, "quality": 60 },
    "vanderlee": { "enabled": true, "quality": 60 },
    "pointfree": { "enabled": false, "quality": 60 },
    "patreon": { "enabled": false }
  },
  "cache": {
    "ttl": 86400
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables (Optional)

For premium features, add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swift": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@efremidze/swift-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PATREON_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📚 Content Sources

### Free Sources

Currently supported, no authentication needed:

| Source | Creator | Content Type | Update Frequency |
|--------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Swift by Sundell** | John Sundell | Articles, patterns, best practices | Weekly |
| **Antoine van der Lee** | Antoine van der Lee | Tutorials, tips, deep dives | Weekly |
| **Point-Free** | Point-Free | Open source libraries, patterns | On release |

### Premium Sources

Requires authentication and active subscriptions:

| Source | What You Get | Setup Method | Status |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Patreon** | Premium content from iOS creators | OAuth 2.0 | ✅ Available |

## 🔐 Premium Integration (Optional)

### Patreon Setup

Access premium content from iOS creators you support:

```bash
swift-mcp setup --patreon
```

Follow the interactive wizard to:
1. Create a Patreon OAuth application
2. Configure credentials
3. Complete authentication

📖 **Detailed Guide**: [Patreon Setup Documentation](docs/PATREON_SETUP.md)

#### Requirements

- Active Patreon account with at least one iOS creator subscription
- Patreon Creator account (free - no need to launch a creator page)
- 10 minutes for one-time OAuth setup

#### Why Creator Account?

Patreon requires OAuth apps to be registered by creators. You don't need to launch a creator page or become an active creator - just register as one to create an OAuth app for personal use.

#### What You Get

- ✅ Access to premium tutorials and patterns from creators you support
- ✅ Automatic extraction of code from downloadable content
- ✅ Quality filtering and advanced search
- ✅ Multi-creator support
- ✅ Private, secure authentication

## ⚙️ Commands

```bash
# Source management
swift-mcp source list
swift-mcp source enable <source-name>
swift-mcp source disable <source-name>

# Configuration
swift-mcp setup
swift-mcp setup --patreon

# Authentication
swift-mcp auth patreon
swift-mcp auth status
```

## 🏗️ How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[AI Assistant] --> B[swift-mcp Server]
    B --> C[Free Sources]
    B --> D[Premium Sources]
    C --> E[Swift by Sundell RSS]
    C --> F[van der Lee RSS]
    C --> G[Point-Free GitHub]
    D --> H[Patreon API]
```

1. **AI Assistant Query**: Your AI assistant sends a query through the MCP protocol
2. **swift-mcp Processing**: The server searches enabled sources based on your query
3. **Content Retrieval**: Fetches and parses content from RSS feeds, APIs, and cached data
4. **Quality Filtering**: Applies configurable quality thresholds
5. **Response**: Returns formatted, relevant patterns and examples to your AI assistant

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Node version incompatible**
```bash
node --version  # Should be >= 18.0.0
```

**Sources not returning results**
```bash
swift-mcp source list
ls ~/.swift-mcp/config.json
swift-mcp setup
```

#### Patreon Integration Issues

**OAuth redirect not working**
- Ensure redirect URI is exactly: `http://localhost:3000/patreon/callback`
- Check no other process is using port 3000
- Verify OAuth credentials are correctly set

**No premium content showing**
- Confirm you have active Patreon subscriptions to iOS creators
- Re-authenticate: `swift-mcp auth patreon`
- Check Patreon source is enabled: `swift-mcp source list`
