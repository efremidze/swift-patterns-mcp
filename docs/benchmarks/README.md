# Benchmark Baselines

This directory stores MCP latency baselines generated by:

```bash
npm run bench
```

You can tune runs/output:

```bash
node scripts/benchmark-mcp.js --runs 10 --out docs/benchmarks/custom.json
```

Each JSON file includes:
- cold process latency (`cold`)
- warm process latency (`warm`)
- percentile metrics (`p50_ms`, `p90_ms`, `p99_ms`)
- success/failure counts and captured errors

Use these files as point-in-time references and compare new runs against the latest baseline for regressions.
